# Tutorca-Website
This project will contain:
 - A website where users can go to book, learn about tutorca, or send any feedback/queries.
 - A database where login details are stored
 - A database where booking information is stored (dictionaries?)
 - A python script to interpret the data and assign mentors to mentees.

Website mostly created from a wix template so credit there.
